## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+
- [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) (for production)

### Local Development

Clone and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neverinfamous/d1-manager.git
cd d1-manager
npm install
```

Start both servers in separate terminals:

**Terminal 1** — Frontend (Vite):

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2** — Worker (Wrangler):

```bash
npx wrangler dev --config wrangler.dev.toml --local
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** — no auth required, mock data included.

---

## 🔧 Production Deployment

### 1. Authenticate with Cloudflare

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

### 2. Create Metadata Database

```bash
npx wrangler d1 create d1-manager-metadata
npx wrangler d1 execute d1-manager-metadata --remote --file=worker/schema.sql
```

### 3. Configure Wrangler

Edit `wrangler.toml` with your `database_id` from step 2:

```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "METADATA"
database_name = "d1-manager-metadata"
database_id = "YOUR_DATABASE_ID_HERE"  # From step 2
```

### 4. Set Up R2 Backup Bucket (Optional)

To enable database backups to R2 storage:

```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket create d1-manager-backups
```

The `wrangler.toml` includes the R2 and Durable Object configuration needed for backups. Features include:
- Backup databases to R2 before rename, STRICT mode, or FTS5 conversion operations
- Manual backup/restore from database cards
- Full backup history with restore capability

### 5. Set Up Cloudflare Access

1. Go to [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Configure authentication (GitHub OAuth, etc.)
3. Create an Access Application for your domain
4. Copy the **Application Audience (AUD) tag**

### 6. Create API Token

1. Go to [Cloudflare API Tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)
2. Create Custom Token with **Account → D1 → Edit** permission

### 7. Set Secrets

```bash
npx wrangler secret put ACCOUNT_ID
npx wrangler secret put API_KEY
npx wrangler secret put TEAM_DOMAIN
npx wrangler secret put POLICY_AUD
```

### 8. Deploy

```bash
npm run build
npx wrangler deploy
```

## ⬆️ Upgrading

### Automated Schema Migrations (Recommended)

D1 Manager includes an automated migration system. When you upgrade to a new version:

1. **Deploy the new version** - The app will automatically detect pending migrations
2. **Click "Upgrade Now"** - A banner appears if schema updates are needed
3. **Done!** - Migrations are applied safely with rollback on failure

The app automatically handles:
- Fresh installations (applies all migrations)
- Legacy installations (detects existing tables and marks appropriate migrations as applied)
- Incremental upgrades (only applies new migrations)

### Manual Schema Update (Alternative)

If you prefer manual control, run the full schema refresh:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute d1-manager-metadata --remote --file=worker/schema.sql
```

Or apply individual migrations:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute d1-manager-metadata --remote --file=worker/migrations/002_add_color_tags.sql
```

| Migration | When to Run |
|-----------|-------------|
| `001_add_job_history.sql` | If you don't have job history tables yet |
| `002_add_color_tags.sql` | If you don't have color tags yet |
| `003_add_error_message_column.sql` | If you have job history but no error_message column |
| `004_add_webhooks.sql` | If you don't have the webhooks table yet |
| `005_add_scheduled_backups.sql` | If you don't have the scheduled_backups table yet |

> **Note:** New installations should use the automated migration system or `schema.sql`.

### Binding Requirements

When upgrading, check if new wrangler.toml bindings are required:

| Version | Required Bindings |
|---------|-------------------|
| v1.0.0 | `METADATA` (D1 database) |
| v1.1.0 | Same as v1.0.0 |
| v1.2.0+ | `METADATA` (D1), `BACKUP_BUCKET` (R2, optional), `BACKUP_DO` (Durable Object, optional) |
| v2.0.0 | Same as v1.2.0 (optional cron trigger for scheduled backups) |
| v2.1.0 | Same as v2.0.0 (optional `[ai]` binding for AI Search) |

### ⚠️ Important: Durable Object Setup for R2 Backups

**If you want R2 backup features** (backup before delete/rename, scheduled backups, restore from R2), you must add a Durable Object binding to your `wrangler.toml`. The Durable Object handles long-running backup operations that exceed Worker CPU limits.

**If you skip this step**, the app will work normally but R2 backup/restore features will be unavailable. You can still use Download/Import for manual backups.

**Upgrading from v1.0.0 or v1.1.x to v2.0.0:**

1. **Add the following to your `wrangler.toml`:**

```toml
# R2 bucket for backups
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "BACKUP_BUCKET"
bucket_name = "d1-manager-backups"

# Durable Object for async backup operations (REQUIRED for R2 backups)
# The Durable Object handles large backup operations that exceed Worker limits
[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "BACKUP_DO"
class_name = "BackupDO"
script_name = "d1-manager"

# Migration tag tells Cloudflare to create the Durable Object class
# This MUST be included on first deploy with Durable Objects
[[migrations]]
tag = "v2_backup_do"
new_classes = ["BackupDO"]
```

2. **Create the R2 bucket:**

```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket create d1-manager-backups
```

3. **Deploy to apply the Durable Object migration:**

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

> **Note:** The `[[migrations]]` block with `tag = "v2_backup_do"` is required on your **first deploy** after adding the Durable Object. Cloudflare uses this to initialize the Durable Object class. You can remove it from `wrangler.toml` after the first successful deploy, but keeping it is harmless.

**Optional: Add scheduled backups**

To enable automated scheduled backups, also add the cron trigger:

```toml
[triggers]
crons = ["0 * * * *"]  # Runs hourly to check for due backups
```

### Redeploy

```bash
git pull origin main
npm install
npm run build
npx wrangler deploy
```

## 📊 External Logging Integration

D1 Manager supports integration with external observability platforms via Cloudflare's native OpenTelemetry export. This allows you to send traces and logs to services like Grafana Cloud, Datadog, Honeycomb, Sentry, and Axiom.

### Option 1: OpenTelemetry Export (Recommended)

Cloudflare Workers natively supports exporting OpenTelemetry-compliant traces and logs to any OTLP endpoint.

**Step 1: Create a destination in Cloudflare Dashboard**

1. Go to [Workers Observability](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/observability/pipelines)
2. Click **Add destination**
3. Configure your provider's OTLP endpoint and authentication headers

**Common OTLP Endpoints:**

| Provider | Traces Endpoint | Logs Endpoint |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Grafana Cloud | `https://otlp-gateway-{region}.grafana.net/otlp/v1/traces` | `https://otlp-gateway-{region}.grafana.net/otlp/v1/logs` |
| Honeycomb | `https://api.honeycomb.io/v1/traces` | `https://api.honeycomb.io/v1/logs` |
| Axiom | `https://api.axiom.co/v1/traces` | `https://api.axiom.co/v1/logs` |
| Sentry | `https://{HOST}/api/{PROJECT_ID}/integration/otlp/v1/traces` | `https://{HOST}/api/{PROJECT_ID}/integration/otlp/v1/logs` |
| Datadog | Coming soon | `https://otlp.{SITE}.datadoghq.com/v1/logs` |

**Step 2: Update wrangler.toml**

```toml
[observability]
enabled = true

[observability.traces]
enabled = true
destinations = ["your-traces-destination"]

[observability.logs]
enabled = true
destinations = ["your-logs-destination"]
```

### Option 2: Application Webhooks

Use the built-in webhook system to send event notifications to any HTTP endpoint (Slack, Discord, custom services).

Configure webhooks in the UI under the **Webhooks** tab.

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

**"Failed to list databases"**
- Verify `ACCOUNT_ID` is correct
- Ensure API token has **D1 Edit** permission (not just Read)

**Authentication loop**
- Check `TEAM_DOMAIN` includes `https://`
- Verify `POLICY_AUD` matches your Access application
