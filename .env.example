# D1 Manager Environment Configuration
#
# How it works:
# - Development: Vite auto-loads .env.development (no config needed)
# - Production: No .env file needed - uses window.location.origin automatically
#
# You should NOT need to create a .env file for normal usage.
# The app auto-detects the correct API URL based on environment.
